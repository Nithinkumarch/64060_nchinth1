# Task 2: Analyze the clusters in relation to the numerical variables that were utilized to create them.
# By taking note of each cluster's mean values for all quantitative variables #... (Cluster interpretation comments)

# Task 3: In relation to the numerical variables (10 to 12), are there any patterns in the clusters?
# (those not utilized in cluster formation)

#Note: It appears that the code provided lacks any analysis pertaining to variables 10 through 12.

# Task 4: Using any or all of the variables in the dataset, give each cluster a suitable name.
#... (Comments on Cluster Naming)
